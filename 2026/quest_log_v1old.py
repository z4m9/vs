1️⃣ add_quest(quests) — Add a new quest
Ask the user to enter a quest 
Add to the quests array using append()
Print a confirmation message

✅ Extensions
Use .strip() method so extra spaces don't affect the input.
Check the input is not empty ("").
Use the in operator to prevent duplicates.

2️⃣ list_quests(quests) — Display all quests
Use len() to check if the list is empty. If it is, display a message such as “No quests yet.” Otherwise, use a loop to display each quest on a new line.

✅ Extensions
Display the quests with numbers (1, 2, 3…) so it matches how you will select quests in complete_quest().
Display the total count: “You have X active quests.”

3️⃣complete_quest(quests) — Complete (remove) a quest
If the list is empty, display a message and return to the menu. Otherwise, display the quests with numbers (1, 2, 3…), then ask the user which quest number to complete, remove the completed quest from the list, and confirm which quest was removed.

✅ Extensions (recommended)
Input validation: if the user types something that isn't a number, display an error message and return to the menu.
Range check: if the user enters 0 or a number larger than the list length, display an error message and return to the menu.
Index conversion: remember list indexes start at 0, so quest number 1 corresponds to index 0.
Empty list handling: after removing, optionally show the updated number of quests remaining.
(Optional extra): Allow the user to type cancel instead of a number to return to the menu.

4️⃣ sort_quests_az(quests) — Sort A-Z
Sort the list using sort() and print a short confirmation message.

✅ Extensions
If the list is empty, print “No quests to sort.”

5️⃣ sort_quests_za(quests) — Sort Z-A
Sort the list using sort(reverse=True) and print a short confirmation message.

✅ Extension
If the list is empty, print “No quests to sort.”

🎲 Generating Random Numbers
Many programs require some level of randomness. For example rolling a dice, triggering a random event in an adventure game, or selecting a random question from a quiz.

Computers do not generate true randomness. Instead, they use mathematical formulas to generate pseudo-random numbers — values that appear random but are produced by an algorithm.

In Python, random numbers are generated using the random module. Before using it, the module must be imported at the top of the program:

import random
Python provides several useful functions, including:

random.randint(a, b) → returns a random integer between a and b (inclusive)
random.choice(list) → selects a random item from a list
For example:

import random

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(random.choice(numbers))
 Each time the program runs, a different value may be selected.

💻Activity — Generating Random Quests
Create a function to  quest_log_v1.py to suggest and display a random quest — def suggest_random_quest(quests):
Adjust the numbering so Quit remains as the last option.
Reuse some of your previous code to check if the list is empty.
Otherwise, use random.choice(quests) to display a randomly selected quest.
Update your menu options and show_menu() to include this new feature.
Run the program multiple times to test this function. You will be asked to upload screenshots of the output and the .pyfile later in this lesson.
